# Usage solve_test

## Compilation

In the `C-or-Cpp` directory, `make` or `make solve_test` will generate an executable `solve_test` from the source files.

## Running

Once compiled, the `solve_test` executable can be run directly from terminal: `./solve_test`

- No files will be produced at this time, however the results from this computing assignment will be displayed in the terminal

## Cleaning

To safely remove the `solve_test` executable, run `make clean` in terminal.
